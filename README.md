# Deepmedic and 3D U-Net for [brain tumor segmentation](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018/tasks.html)

We created two popular deep learning models DeepMedic and 3D U-Net in PyTorch for the purpose of brain tumor segmentation. The performance of our proposed ensemble on BraTS 2018 dataset is shown in the following table:

|Dataset|Dice(ET)|Dice(WT)|Dice(TC)|Hausdorff95(ET)|Hausdorff95(WT)|Hausdorff95(TC)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Testing|0.782|0.908|0.823|2.96|4.39|6.91|

For more details about our methodology, please refer to our [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01449/full)
For the training set, we use 5-folds cross validation. ET:Enhancing tumor, WT: whole tumor, TC: tumor core.The final trained model for multiclass classification is included along with the results on test dataset.

The system was employed for our research presented in [1,2], where the we integrate multiple DeepMedics and 3D U-Nets in order to get a robust tumor segmentation mask. We also utilize the brain parcellation masks for the purpose of bringing the location information to DeepMedic and 3D U-Net. If the use of the software or the idea of the paper positively influences your endeavours, please cite [1,2].
